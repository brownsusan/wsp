		<h2>Site intent</h2>
			<p>This siteâ€™s intent is to entice users into choosing to rent Casa Guacamole for their Puerto Vallarta vacation. In order to support this intent focus will be placed on the gallery pages, and the reservation page. Information will be organized in a way that is more intuitive to navigate based on similar sites in order to support consistency and typical user behavior patterns. </p>

		<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
			<p>Casa Guacamole has positive and competitive ratings on third party websites such as a 5 star rating on VRBO. As far as information architecture, the site's competitors have a more organized and logical flow of content. In addition, to remain competitive with similar sites, the code needs to be made more semantic to improve search results ratings and provide better accessibility. Another way that the code could be improved upon would be implementing the separation of structure and style. </p>
			<p>Casa guacamole is also not using any form of keywords or meta data in their site. Most of their competitors are using meta data in order to enhance their web presence.</p>
