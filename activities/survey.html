<h1>Casa Guacamole Usability Survey</h1>

<p>Thank you for participating in the Casa Guacamole website survey. The survey serves as an evaluation of how easy our website is to use. After rating the difficulty of 3 tasks, we will ask you a few short questions and to share with us how your overall experience was. Your absolute honesty is greatly appreciated!
Please note that none of your personal information will be recorded on the site, all submit buttons are dead links, that will simply clear the form information.
And remember that there are no wrong answers - this is not a test of YOU, but rather a test of the SITE. 
Thank you again, for your participation!
