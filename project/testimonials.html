			<h4>A.W. - Mississippi</h4>
			<p>Casa guacamole is a beautiful casa located on the hillside behind the cathedral in gringo gulch. It was a nice walk to town and all the favorite hot spots and restaurants. The casa is very roomy and was a great choice for our first annual ladies week vacation. Every bedroom has an ocean view. It was very secure and the staff was most excellent. We never experienced any problems, we all found it to be the most perfect place for a relaxing vacation. What really made it stand out was the beauty of the architecture and the lovely art work that adorned the walls, the care the staff takes to ensure that you want for nothing. It was also a major plus to have access to the Internet and free calls back home to our spouses to let them know that everything was going great. For the budget minded travelers, you will never find a better deal in all of Vallarta, for everything Casa Guacamole offers. I would highly recommend this Casa to anyone looking for privacy to do as they wish and breathtaking views."</p>
			
			<h4>M.J. - Missouri</h4>
			<p>"We were a party of 7 who stayed at Casa Guacamole in January. It was fantastic!! The house,furnishings,location were perfect.The walk up the hill was steep, but we enjoyed the workout. All the staff made out stay wonderful. It was paradise!"</p>
			
			<h4>J.L. - Washington</h4>
			<p>"It has been almost a year since my week-long stay in paradise, and I am SO sorry not to be returning this year. Despite the stormy weather last October,our stay at Casa Guacamole was anything but. Best vacation I've ever had. The staff were wonderful, and the villa is beyond beautiful. I hope to make it down next year! One more note--I have severe arthritis in my knees, and the hill and stairs were very tough. I would crawl up the stairs if necessary to stay at Casa Guacamole again!! As for the hill--cabs are inexpensive. :)"</p>
			
			<h4>M.D. - California</h4>
			<p>"I stayed at Casa Guacamole for a week last September. The house is IMMACULATE and beautifully decorated, and in an ideal location in Puerto Vallarta. The views from the house are some of the best in PV...I give this property a 5 out of 5 stars...highest rating I've ever given to any property."</p>
			
			<h4>A.G. - South Carolina</h4>
			<p>"We have rented a few vacation homes, this house is by far the nicest and most fully equipped. The area is wonderful as are the people who work in the house.The sunsets and views of the bay are to be seen for yourself. My family and I can not wait to go back. We went with 6 people, 2 of which were in their late 70's and we all loved it. With the 4 large bedrooms with the king sized beds, you can go with any combination of people and have fun and privacy. Sit out by the heated pool with a drink, or grill at sunset, and for that small amount of time you will not want to be anywhere else."</p>
			
			<h4>S.M. - Texas</h4>
			<p>"My friends and I had a wonderful time staying at Casa Guacamole from the moment we arrived until our last minute there. It is a spectacular villa and the pictures don't really do it justice, it is much nicer in person. The staff was very attentive and helpful and it was a great place to just kick back and relax or take a walk into town.. Even with the hill and stairs, everyone in our party agrees that when we return to PV, Casa Guacamole is the place for us."</p>
			
			<h4>D.J. - Maine </h4>
			<p>"One couldn't ask for a better vacation get away! The villa is clean, beautifully decorated, and those views,incredible!! And from every room. It is nearby some of the best restaurants in PV. It is close to everything yet private enough to feel like you have paradise to yourselves. The staff was great. We were met at the airport by the driver which was so easy and stress free, we highly recommend this service. The concierge arranged some excursions for us and they were great. Casa Guacamole will be our new annual special treat to ourselves, a home away from home."e</p>
			
			<h4>T.S. - California</h4> 
			<p>"I celebrated my birthday at Casa Guacamole with 6 friends and the entire experience was fantastic. The villa is extraordinarily beautiful and the location is fantastic.It is set up high on a hill above downtown PV so there are stairs to climb but it is well worth it for the privacy and the serene views. The rooms are very nicely appointed and the service was first rate. I cannot wait to go back."</p>
			
			<h4>D.S. - Illinois</h4>
			<p>"The family cousins got together for our annual reunion. This is first time we vacationed in Puerto Vallarta and at Casa Guacamole. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived at the Casa. You walk through the door and you know you are in Mexico. The house is beautiful and roomy. It is decorated very tastefully with an eclectic mix that works so well. My cousin called it Mexi-chic. The concierge was at the villa when we arrived and was very helpful. We were given a tour and told how to operate the AC and the TV's and where all the light switches were.</p>
			
			<p>"We had arranged for the cook ahead of time and the concierge explained what time she would arrive and what to expect. What we didn't expect was how amazing our first meal was. Typical Mexican fare, just simply delicious. We ended up hiring the cook 4 out of the 7 nights we were there. We highly recommend the cook and the price was great. We all fought over the bedrooms which were very nice and they all have a view.so it was easy to work out. The third floor bedroom is very special with your own private terrace and incredible views of the entire bay. You even have a view from the shower. We barbecued most days for lunch on the great gas built-in grill which is poolside. We felt like spoiling ourselves on our last day there and hired Manuel the bartender to make drinks for us while we lounged by the pool. He was great and very attentive. Regretfully we did not discover him sooner. We can't say enough good things about Casa Guacamole, best family get together ever. Can't wait to return."</p>
			
			<h4>J.U. - New Jersey</h4>
			<p>"We were 8 friends that discovered Casa Guacamole on line and booked our annual trip simply based on the photos and description, and of course the price. What we found out was that we got way more than we expected for what we paid for the week. We were amazed with the decor, just beautiful. Casa Guacamole is definitely high end with budget prices for a private villa with that location. The staff was great and very helpful. There is a DVD collection in the main TV room which we enjoyed a few nights and a selection of games and books. Everything was very thought out. We hired the cook which turned out to be a great decision, very authentic and lots of leftovers from dinner. Highly recommended! It was a very relaxing vacation with lots of margaritas poolside. We have never vacationed in the same place twice but Casa Guacamole is so special that we have already decided to return and have booked our next trip."</p>
